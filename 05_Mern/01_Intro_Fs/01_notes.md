How Are We Going to Learn Node.js Development?
To build a full-stack MERN application (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), follow this roadmap:

1. Basic JavaScript Knowledge
    Have a strong foundation in JavaScript before diving into Node.js.

2. Node.js Fundamentals
    Learn installation, core modules, and how the Node.js runtime works.

3. Module and Package Management
    Use npm to manage dependencies.
    Learn how to:
        Initialize a project
        Install packages
        Create package.json

4. Server Concepts with Node.js
    Build basic HTTP servers using core Node.js.
    Handle requests and send responses.

5. Web Server with Express.js
    Learn to set up routes, handle HTTP requests, and use middleware.

6. RESTful API with Express
    Understand HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE (Using Postman)
    Best practices for APIs

7. MVC Architecture
    Structure code into:
        Model
        View
        Controller

✅ 8. MongoDB
    Learn to:
        Install MongoDB
        Perform CRUD operations
        Work with collections and documents

✅ 9. Mongoose
    ODM library for MongoDB
    Schema definitions and simplified operations

✅ 10. JWT Authentication
    Secure APIs with JSON Web Tokens

✅ 11. React Integration
    Build frontend using React:
    Components
    State management
    UI rendering

✅ 12. MERN App Integration
    Combine Node, Express, MongoDB, React into a full-stack project(BookMyShow App).

✅ 13. Miscellaneous
    Error handling
    Deployment
    Performance optimization

✅ 14. Practice and Projects
    Work on progressively complex projects for hands-on experience.
